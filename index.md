Do you write code that needs to run more quickly?  For computationally intensive code, improving performance is an important concern.

Parallel computing provides techniques to write programs that use multiple processor cores.  A major difference all between modern computers, from a few cores on personal laptop to largest supercomputer, is in the number of available processor cores.  In all cases, learning how to harness the additional compute power of multiple cores can be a big boost to how fast you can get results from the programs that you run.

This workshop is split into two halves.  Lessons in the first half describe Parallel Computing concepts and issues, while the second half then applies these concepts to practical examples in the MATLAB language.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Just a general knowledge of programming is useful for the first half of this workshop. A background in the MATLAB programming language is important for following along with the workshop's second half.
>
> Although not required, we would advise you to bring a laptop with MATLAB already installed, so you can follow along and try code examples yourself.
