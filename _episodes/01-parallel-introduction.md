## What is Parallel Computing?

 - Sequential vs Parallel

## Why use Parallel Computing?

 - Why Parallel?
   - Hardware: thermal limits of processors
     - Moore's Law
     - (get graph showing historic limit of processor speed)
     - Can't get faster clock speed
     - More cores instead of faster cores

## Using cores: Parallel vs Sequential Batch

 - Briefly describe our definition of batch
 - Mention how it can be useful for certain classes of problems, give some examples
 - Out-of-scope for this lesson
