Some of these topics may go in a later section.  But I wanted to capture them somewhere for now:

  - Parallel in Matlab
  - Using `tic`/`toc` commands
  - Tutorial on Matlab profiler should be somewhere
  - Automatic multicore: Vectorization
      - Example that does well
      - Example that doesn't do as well *(can I find one?)*
  - Introduce *parfor* command
  - Discuss -singleCompThread
      - Mention how it cann affect speedup calculation (e.g. might not really be comparing sequential against parallel)
  - Categories Variable classification in parfor
  - Random Number Generation in parfor
  - lots of printing to command window can be slow
